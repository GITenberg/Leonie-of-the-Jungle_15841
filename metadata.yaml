description: Death and despair are never far behind the beautiful Leonie Hetth. Orphaned
  in India at four months old and raised by her vapid, aging maiden aunt in cold,
  wet England, Leonie has no one to turn to when her nightmares begin taking their
  toll on those around her. Only young brain surgeon Jonathan Cuxson, Jr., seems to
  understand her. Following in his late father's footsteps, he's determined to discover
  the root of Leonie's destructive bouts of sleepwalking and unconscious Hindustani
  mutterings. And somewhere, deep in the jungle, a mad priest waits patiently for
  his entranced human sacrifice to reach India's shores...
